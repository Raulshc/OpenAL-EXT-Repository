EAX4.0EMULATED

This extension indicates the EAX4 API is supported, but only a subset
of functionality is implemented via EAX2 translation calls.

As some call functions are supported, but some calls are no-ops, it means a limit
in the resulting sound behavior.

    *Only EAX_REVERB_EFFECT is supported
    *Only 1 auxiliary send per source is supported.
