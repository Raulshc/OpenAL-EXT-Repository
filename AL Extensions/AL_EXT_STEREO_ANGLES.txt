Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.

Overview

        This extension allows any stereo source to be "steered" by setting the
        angles at which the left and right channels should play.

Issues

        None

New Procedures and Functions

        None

New Tokens

        Accepted as the <param> parameter of alSourcefv and alGetSourcefv:

            AL_STEREO_ANGLES                          0x1030


Additions to Specification

        The AL_STEREO_ANGLES tag can be used with alSourcefv() and two angles. The
        angles are specified anticlockwise relative to the real front
        (AL_SOURCE_RELATIVE is not supported) and are always specified in radians,
        so a normal 60degree front stage is specified with:

        alSourcefv(sid, AL_STEREO_ANGLES, +M_PI/6, -M_PI/6);
