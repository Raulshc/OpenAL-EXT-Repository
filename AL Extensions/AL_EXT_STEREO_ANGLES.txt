Overview

        This extension allows any stereo source to be "steered" by setting 
        the angles at which the left and right channels should play. Angles 
        are always specified in radians, anticlockwise relative to the real 
        front (AL_SOURCE_RELATIVE is not supported).

Issues

        The AL_STEREO_ANGLES tag can be used with alSourcefv() and two angles. 
        The angles are specified anticlockwise relative to the real front, so 
        a normal 60degree front stage is specified with:

        alSourcefv(sid,AL_STEREO_ANGLES,+M_PI/6,-M_PI/6).
