Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.0 specification.

Overview

        This extension allows an application written to the OpenAL 1.0
        specification to access the offset abilities.

Additions to Specification

        Append to Section 4.3.2, Source Attributes

        Offset

        Table 4.20: Source AL_SEC_OFFSET Attribute

        Name                        Signature  Values           Default
        --------------------------  ---------  ---------------  --------------
        AL_SEC_OFFSET               f,fv,i,iv  [0.0f, any],     N/A

        Description: the playback position, expressed in seconds
        (the value will loop back to zero for looping sources).

        When setting AL_SEC_OFFSET on a source which is already playing, the
        playback will jump to the new offset unless the new offset is out of
        range, in which case an AL_INVALID_VALUE error is set. If the source
        is not playing, then the offset will be applied on the next
        alSourcePlay call.

        The position is relative to the beginning of all the queued buffers
        for the source, and any queued buffers traversed by a set call will
        be marked as processed.

        This value is based on byte position, so a pitch-shifted source will
        have an exaggerated playback speed. For example, you can be 0.500
        seconds into a buffer having taken only 0.250 seconds to get there if
        the pitch is set to 2.0.

        Table 4.21: Source AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET Attribute

        Name                        Signature  Values           Default
        --------------------------  ---------  ---------------  --------------
        AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET            f,fv,i,iv  [0.0f, any],     N/A

        Description: the playback position, expressed in samples (the value
        will loop back to zero for looping sources). For a compressed format,
        this value will represent an exact offsetwithin the uncompressed data.

        When setting AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET on a source which is already playing,
        the playback will jump to the new offset unless the new offset is out
        of range, in which case an AL_INVALID_VALUE error is set. If the
        source is not playing, then the offset will be applied on the next
        alSourcePlay call. An alSourceStop, alSourceRewind, or a second
        alSourcePlay call will reset the offset to the beginning of the
        buffer.

        The position is relative to the beginning of all the queued buffers
        for the source, and any queued buffers traversed by a set call will
        be marked as processed.

        Table 4.22: Source AL_BYTE_OFFSET Attribute

        Name                        Signature  Values           Default
        --------------------------  ---------  ---------------  --------------
        AL_BYTE_OFFSET              f,fv,i,iv  [0.0f, any],     N/A

        Description: the playback position, expressed in bytes (the value
        will loop back to zero for looping sources). For a compressed format,
        this value may represent an approximateoffset within the compressed
        data buffer.

        When setting AL_BYTE_OFFSET on a source which is already playing,
        the playback will jump to the new offset unless the new offset is out
        of range, in which case an AL_INVALID_VALUE error is set. If the
        source is not playing, then the offset will be applied on the next
        alSourcePlay call. An alSourceStop, alSourceRewind, or a second
        alSourcePlay call will reset the offset to the beginning of the
        buffer.

        The position is relative to the beginning of all the queued buffers
        for the source, and any queued buffers traversed by a set call will
        be marked as processed.


Errors

        An AL_INVALID_VALUE error is generating if on a source which is
        already playing, the playback will jump to the new offset that
        is out of range.
