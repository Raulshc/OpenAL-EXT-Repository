Overview
        This extension provides an alternative to the OpenAL polling mechanism used
        for obtaining state about Source and Buffer objects. The caller subscribes to
        the notification scheme by providing a callback function for the desired
        notification type. When a notification is received, the caller should then
        proceed to get the current state using the native OpenAL api calls.

        The available notification types are

          AL_SOURCE_STATE       - there is a change in the source's state
          AL_BUFFERS_PROCESSED  - there is a change in the number of buffers processed
          AL_QUEUE_HAS_LOOPED   - the buffer queue has looped (if looping is enabled)

New Procedures and Functions

        ALenum alSourceAddNotification(ALuint sid, ALuint notificationID,
                                       alSourceNotificationProc notifyProc, ALvoid* userData);

        ALvoid alSourceRemoveNotification(ALuint sid, ALuint notificationID,
                                       alSourceNotificationProc notifyProc, ALvoid* userData);

New Types

        typedef ALvoid (*alSourceNotificationProc)(ALuint sid, ALuint notificationID,
                                                   ALvoid* userData)

New Tokens

        AL_QUEUE_HAS_LOOPED                       0x9000

Additions to Specification

    Eliminates the need for continuous polling for source state by providing a
    mechanism for the application to receive source state change notifications.
    Upon receiving a notification, the application can retrieve the actual state
    corresponding to the notification ID for which the notification was sent.

    Notification Proc:  ALSourceNotificationProc

    sid             - source id
    notificationID  - id of state that has changed
    userData        - user data provided to alSourceAddNotification()

    API: alSourceAddNotification

    sid             - source id
    notificationID  - id of state for which caller wants to be notified of a change
    notifyProc      - notification proc
    userData        - ptr to applications user data, will be returned in the notification proc

    Returns AL_NO_ERROR if request is successful.

    Valid IDs:
      AL_SOURCE_STATE
      AL_BUFFERS_PROCESSED
      AL_QUEUE_HAS_LOOPED - notification sent when a looping source has looped to it's start point

    API: alSourceRemoveStateNotification

    sid             - source id
    notificationID  - id of state for which caller wants to remove an existing notification
    notifyProc      - notification proc
    userData        - ptr to applications user data, will be returned in the notification proc
