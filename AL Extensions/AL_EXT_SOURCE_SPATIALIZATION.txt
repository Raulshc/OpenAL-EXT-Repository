Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.
        This extension interacts with ALC_EXT_MAC_OSX.

Overview

        Allows the rendering quality to be explicitly set on a source object,
        overriding the default render quality set via alcMacOSXRenderingQuality().
        A subsequent call to alcMacOSXRenderingQuality() resets the render quality
        of all source objects.

        Uses the same render settings (defined above) as alcMacOSXRenderingQuality():

            ALC_MAC_OSX_SPATIAL_RENDERING_QUALITY_HIGH
            ALC_MAC_OSX_SPATIAL_RENDERING_QUALITY_LOW

Issues

        None

New Procedures and Functions

        ALvoid alSourceRenderingQuality(ALuint sid, ALint value);
        ALint  alSourceGetRenderingQuality(ALuint sid);

New Tokens

        Accepted as the <value> parameter of alSourceRenderingQuality:

            ALC_MAC_OSX_SPATIAL_RENDERING_QUALITY_HIGH           'rqhi'
            ALC_MAC_OSX_SPATIAL_RENDERING_QUALITY_LOW            'rdlo'
