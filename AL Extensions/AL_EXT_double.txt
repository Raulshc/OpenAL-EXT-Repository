Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.

Overview

        This extension provides format support for uncompressed PCM data in 64-bit
        double-precision floating-point IEEE format. Use of audio data in this
        format may be more efficient for the implementation to process. An
        implementation that exposes this extension will accept two new data formats
        in alBufferData().
