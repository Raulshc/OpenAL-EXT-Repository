Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.

Overview

        This extension provides format support for uncompressed PCM data in 32-bit
        float IEEE format. Use of audio data in this format may be more efficient
        for the implementation to process. An implementation that exposes this
        extension will accept two new data formats in alBufferData().
