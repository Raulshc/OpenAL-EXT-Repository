Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.

Overview

        This extension provides a means for the caller to avoid the overhead
        associated with the alBufferData call which performs a physical copy of
        the data provided by the caller to internal buffers.

        When using the AL_EXT_STATIC_BUFFER extension, OpenAL's internal buffers
        use the data pointer provided by the caller for all data access.
