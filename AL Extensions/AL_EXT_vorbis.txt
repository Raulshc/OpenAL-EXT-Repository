Overview

        This extension provides format support for ogg vorbis.
        Use of this extension allows the association of ogg vorbis
        data in addition to PCM formats for buffer data.

Issues

        The caveats and restrictions that relate to all formats supported
        via the callback mechanism apply.  Namely, certain filters that
        rely on having all data present to operate (like the pitch operation)
        may result in NOP.  This format tag is invalid as an internalFormat
        hint to functions that accept them.

        This extension can be fully utilized by using the extended token
        in conjunction with BufferData.
