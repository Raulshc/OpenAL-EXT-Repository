Name Strings

        AL_EXT_mp3

Version

        1.0

Number

        ??

Dependencies

        Linux implementation -- LOKI_buffer_data_callback
        MacOS implementation -- None
        Windows implementation -- must have libvorbisfile.dll installed separately

Overview

        AL_EXT_mp3 works just like AL EXT vorbis, but uses AL_FORMAT_MP3_EXT
        for the format token instead of AL_FORMAT_VORBIS_EXT, and obviously
        expects MP3 data instead of Ogg Vorbis packets.

Issues

        The caveats and restrictions that relate to all formats supported
        via the callback mechanism apply.  Namely, certain filters that
        rely on having all data present to operate (like the pitch operation)
        may result in NOP.  This format tag is invalid as an internalFormat
        hint to functions that accept them.

        This extension can be fully utilized by using the extended token
        in conjunction with BufferData.
