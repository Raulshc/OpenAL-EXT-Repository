Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.0 specification.
        This extension trivially interacts with AL_EXT_EXPONENT_DISTANCE.

Overview

        This extension allows an application written to the OpenAL 1.0
        specification to access the offset abilities expressed in sections
        3.4.3 and 3.4.4.

Issues

        None.

New Procedures and Functions

        None.

New Tokens

Additions to Specification

        Modify Section 3.4, Attenuation By Distance

        "... might ultimately limit the overall gain to a value below 1.0.

        OpenAL currently supports three modes of operation with respect to
        distance attenuation,including one that is similar to the IASIG I3DL2
        model. The application can choose one of these models (or chooses to 
        disable distance-dependent attenuation) on a per-context basis.

            void alDistanceModel(ALenum modelName);

        Legal arguments are AL_NONE, AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE,
        AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_CLAMPED, AL_LINEAR_DISTANCE,
        AL_LINEAR_DISTANCE_CLAMPED, AL_EXPONENT_DISTANCE, and
        AL_EXPONENT_DISTANCE_CLAMPED. AL_NONE bypasses all distance
        attenuation calculation for all sources. The implementation is 
        expectedto optimize this situation. AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_CLAMPED is 
        the IASIG I3DL2 model, with AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE indicating both
        the reference distance and the distance below which gain will be
        clamped. AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE is equivalent to the IASIG I3DL2 model
        with the exception that AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE does not imply any 
        clamping.The linear models are not physically realistic, but do 
        allow full attenuation of a source beyond a specified distance.
        The OpenAL implementation is still free to apply any range clamping
        as necessary. The current distance model chosen can be queried using
        alGetInteger{v} and AL_DISTANCE_MODEL.

        With all the distance models, if the formula can not be evaluated then
        the source will not be attenuated. For example, if a linear model is 
        being used with AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE equal to AL_MAX_DISTANCE, then
        the gain equation will have a divide-by-zero error in it. In this case,
        there is no attenuation for that source.

        The default attenuation model is AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_CLAMPED."

        Append Section 3.4.3, Linear Distance Rolloff Model

        This models a linear drop-off in gain as distance increases between the
        source and listener.

            distance = min(distance, AL_MAX_DISTANCE) // avoid negative gain
            gain = (1 - AL_ROLLOFF_FACTOR * (distance - AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE) /
                                            (AL_MAX_DISTANCE - AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE))

        Append Section 3.4.4, Linear Distance Clamped Model

        This is the linear model, extended to guarantee that for distances below
        AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE, gain is clamped.

            distance = max(distance, AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE)
            distance = min(distance, AL_MAX_DISTANCE)
            gain = (1 - AL_ROLLOFF_FACTOR * (distance - AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE) /
                                            (AL_MAX_DISTANCE - AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE))

Errors

        An AL_INVALID_VALUE error is generating if the specified distance model 
        is not valid.

        An AL_INVALID_OPERATION error is generating if there is no current 
        context.
