Overview

        This extension allows any mono source to be changed to be a "large"
        source with a radius. The source has a raised cosine shape.

Issues

        The AL_SOURCE_RADIUS tag can be used with alSourcef() to set the 
        source radius. Units are consistent with the coordinate system in
        use. The value must be at least zero. Use a value of zero to reset
        to a point source.
