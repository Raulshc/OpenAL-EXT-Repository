Additions to Specification

        The AL_SOURCE_RADIUS tag can be used with alSourcef() to set the source
        radius. The source has a raised cosine shape. Units are consistent with
        the coordinate system in use. The valuemust be at least zero. Use a value
        of zero to reset to a point source.
