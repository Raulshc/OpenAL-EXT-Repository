Overview

        This extension indicates that a number of multichannel MULAW formats
        are available beyond the basic mono/stereo set provided by AL_EXT_MULAW.
        The list is AL_FORMAT_MONO_MULAW, AL_FORMAT_STEREO_MULAW,
        AL_FORMAT_QUAD_MULAW, AL_FORMAT_REAR_MULAW, AL_FORMAT_51CHN_MULAW,
        AL_FORMAT_61CHN_MULAW and AL_FORMAT_71CHN_MULAW. Note that the first two
        have the same enum values as the formats in AL_EXT_MULAW and describe the
        same format.

Issues

        MULAW encodes a sample value into each byte using a non-linear encoding.
        Channels appear in the following order as in AL_EXT_MCFORMATS.

New Procedures and Functions

        None.
