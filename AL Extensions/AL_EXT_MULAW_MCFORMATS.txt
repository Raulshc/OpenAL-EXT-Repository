Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.
        This extension extends AL_EXT_MULAW and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS.

Overview

        This extension indicates that a number of multichannel MULAW formats are
        available beyond the basic mono/stereo set provided by AL_EXT_MULAW. The
        list is AL_FORMAT_MONO_MULAW, AL_FORMAT_STEREO_MULAW,AL_FORMAT_QUAD_MULAW,
        AL_FORMAT_REAR_MULAW, AL_FORMAT_51CHN_MULAW,AL_FORMAT_61CHN_MULAW and
        AL_FORMAT_71CHN_MULAW. Note that the first two have the same enum values
        as the formats in AL_EXT_MULAW and describe the same format.

Issues

        MULAW encodes a sample value into each byte using a non-linear encoding.
        Channels appear in the following order as in AL_EXT_MCFORMATS.
