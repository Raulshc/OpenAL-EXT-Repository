Overview

        This extension indicates support for the AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT2D_8,
        AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT2D_16, AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT2D_FLOAT32, AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT3D_8,
        AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT3D_16 and AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT3D_FLOAT32 buffer formats.

        These provide 2D (WXY) and 3D (WXYZ) 8bit int, 16bit int and ALfloat
        support for Ambisonic three- or four-channel B-Format (using W X Y Z channel
        ordering,encoded as the first three or four channels of Furse-Malham higher
        order Ambisonics). Use of these formats indicate that sources are Ambisonic
        sources. Such sources can beoriented via alSourcefv() using the AL_ORIENTATION
        tag, which takes the same parameters as alListenerfv(AL_ORIENTATION,...).
        Such sources DO support AL_SOURCE_RELATIVE and the soundfield will rotate to
        reflect the listener's orientation if this is off (the default).
        Other behaviour is as for stereo or multichannel assets.

Issues

        Note that Ambisonics orients X, Y and Z axes in a different way to OpenAL.
        For clarity, we ignore the Ambisonic coordinate system in the API and stick
        to the OpenAL one, making sure that the Front of the Ambisonic soundfield
        (actually Ambisonic +X) matches the Front of the OpenAL coordinate system
        (-Z by default) etc. For instance, if the orientation of the source is set
        so that the "at" vector is to the left, then the front of the B-Format
        soundfield will be presented to the left.
