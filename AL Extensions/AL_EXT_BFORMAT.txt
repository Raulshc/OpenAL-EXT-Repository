This extension indicates support for the AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT2D_8,
AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT2D_16, AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT2D_FLOAT32, AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT3D_8,
AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT3D_16 and AL_FORMAT_BFORMAT3D_FLOAT32 buffer formats.

These provide 2D (WXY) and 3D (WXYZ) 8bit int, 16bit int and ALfloat support
for Ambisonic three- or four-channel B-Format (using W X Y Z channel ordering,
encoded as the first three or four channels of Furse-Malham higher order Ambisonics).
Use of these formats indicate that sources are Ambisonic sources. Such sources can be
oriented via alSourcefv() using the AL_ORIENTATION tag, which takes the same parameters
as alListenerfv(AL_ORIENTATION,...). Such sources DO support AL_SOURCE_RELATIVE and the
soundfield will rotate to reflect the listener's orientation if this is off (the default).
Other behaviour is as for stereo or multichannel assets.

Note that Ambisonics orients X, Y and Z axes in a different way to OpenAL. For clarity,
we ignore the Ambisonic coordinate system in the API and stick to the OpenAL one, making
sure that the Front of the Ambisonic soundfield (actually Ambisonic +X) matches the Front
of the OpenAL coordinate system (-Z by default) etc. For instance, if the orientation of
the source is set so that the "at" vector is to the left, then the front of the B-Format
soundfield will be presented to the left.
