Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.
    This extension extends AL_EXT_source_distance_model.

Overview

    This extension allows each source to enable or disable distance delayed
    property changes that occur due to the maximum speed of sound. It provides
    a mechanism for applications to enable, or disable, distance delaying
    when specifying either the default distance model or for every source
    individually.

Issues

    Q: What is the default behavior?
    A: Distance delaying is disabled by default.

    Q: What happens if there is an intentional jump in the distance between
       one or more sources and the listener.
    A: The implementation does not guess if such an event takes place.
       As a result the distance delay might get misaligned with the actual
       situation. It is up to the application to tell the implementation to
       re-initialize the distance delay parameters if such an event happens.

Additions to Specification

    Append Section 2.8 (Controlling AL Execution, p. 17)

    The table below specifies the acceptable target capabilities:

    Table 2.x: Context capability targets

    Name                         Description
    ------------------------     -----------------
    AL_DISTANCE_DELAY_MODEL_AAX  Enables delayed source property changes
                                 caused by the maximum speed of sound.
                                 (default is disabled)


    Modify Section 3.4 (Attenuation By Distance), p. 24

    (modify starting from fourth paragraph)
    Legal arguments are AL_NONE, AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE,
    AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_DELAY_AAX, AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_CLAMPED,
    AL_INVERSE_DISTANCE_DELAY_CLAMPED_AAX,  AL_LINEAR_DISTANCE,
    AL_LINEAR_DISTANCE_DELAY_AAX, AL_LINEAR_DISTANCE_CLAMPED,
    AL_LINEAR_DISTANCE_DELAY_CLAMPED_AAX, AL_EXPONENT_DISTANCE,
    AL_EXPONENT_DISTANCE_DELAY_AAX, AL_EXPONENT_DISTANCE_CLAMPED,
    and AL_EXPONENT_DISTANCE_DELAY_CLAMPED_AAX.


    Add Section 3.5.3 (Distance Dependent Property Changes), p. 30

    In reality property changes at the source location take time to reach
    the listener because the speed of sound has a maximum value. The time
    it takes to reach the listener is dependent of the speed of sound and
    the distance between the source and the listener.

    Actually the time it takes to reach the listener also depends on the
    motion of the medium (usually air) between the source and the listener
    but that is not taken into account since it's effect is normally very small.

    SS: AL_SPEED_OF_SOUND - speed of sound (default value 343.3)
    vsl: source-to-listener vector

    dist: distance between the source and the listener.
    delay: distance delay in seconds.

    Distance Delay Calculation:

    dist = Mag(vsl);
    delay = dist/SS;


    Modify Section 4.3.2 (Source Attributes)

    (add after subsection Distance Model Attributes, p. 38)

    Distance Delay Attributes
 
    Table 4.x: SOURCE_STATE Attribute
    Name                         Signature   Values     Default
    ---------------------------  ---------   ---------  -------
    AL_DISTANCE_DELAY_MODEL_AAX  i, iv      AL_INITIAL  N/A

    Description: The application can trigger re-initialization of distance
    delay properties by using alSource with parameter name
    AL_DISTANCE_DELAY_MODEL_AAX and value name AL_INITIAL. This is required
    every time the source or the listener makes a sudden, non continuous,
    jump from one position to another. This is a one time event.
