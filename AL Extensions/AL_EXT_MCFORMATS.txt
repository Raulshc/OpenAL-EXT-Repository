Overview

        This extension provides support for surround sound buffer formats with 8, 16,
        and 32-bit samples.

                 Rear Right).
        QUAD16:  Signed 16-bit, Quadraphonic.
        QUAD32:  32-bit float, Quadraphonic.
        REAR8:   Unsigned 8-bit, Rear Stereo (Rear Left, Rear Right).
        REAR16:  Signed 16-bit, Rear Stereo.
