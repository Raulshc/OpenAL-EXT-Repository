Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.
    This extension interacts with ALC_SOFT_loopback.
    This extension trivially interacts with ALC_SOFT_HRTF.
    This extension trivially interacts with ALC_SOFT_output_limiter.

Overview

    This extension provides a method for applications to request a particular
    output mode for playback devices, and query what's in use. With standard
    OpenAL, the output mode is at the sole discretion of the library, with the
    application having no way to know what's being used. While this works fine
    most of the time (typically the library will be able to query the system
    configuration and auto-select a mode to match, and the app handles sounds
    as being in 3D space), this is sometimes not possible or the most ideal
    option for all use-cases. There are also cases where a desirable output
    mode isn't distinguishable by the device configuration, for example with
    stereo vs UHJ vs HRTF.

Issues

    Q: OpenAL has historically kept the channel configuration hidden from the
       app, as it allows more flexibility to support additional and future
       formats. Is it a problem to expose it here?
    A: Should be fine. It is designed in a way to minimize potential problems.
       To begin with, the format list includes an "any" catch-all that can be
       returned in the event that the output can't be represented with one of
       the formats. Secondly, the format list is fixed, so there won't be a
       risk of apps getting confused with new enums in the future. So esoteric
       or future configurations can still work by reporting "any". More
       formats can also be added with a future extension using a different
       query enum (e.g. ALC_OUTPUT_MODE2_SOFT).

    Q: Why expose the output mode?
    A: There are occasions where it's useful to know the output mode for
       optimal behavior. For example, when an app wants to play multi-channel
       content directly on speakers (using AL_DIRECT_CHANNELS_SOFT=on/remix),
       ensuring the output mode matches or is a superset of the format being
       played is preferrable. When the output mode is a mismatching speaker
       configuration (e.g. 5.1 buffer on quad, HRTF, or UHJ output), using
       virtual speaker panning (AL_DIRECT_CHANNELS_SOFT=off) might be better.
       This extension is also adding an option to request UHJ rendering like
       how ALC_SOFT_HRTF allows requesting HRTF rendering, in a more generic
       way.

Additions to Specification

    Output Mode Selection

    An application may request a desired output mode by specifying the
    ALC_OUTPUT_MODE_SOFT attribute to alcCreateContext (or alcResetDeviceSOFT
    if ALC_SOFT_HRTF or ALC_SOFT_output_limiter are supported). The attribute
    value may be one of:

    Value                 | Meaning
    ==========================================================================
    ALC_ANY_SOFT          | Any (default). Autodetect from the system when
                          | possible.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALC_MONO_SOFT         | Monaural.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALC_STEREO_SOFT       | 2-channel stereophonic. An umbrella mode covering
                          | the other stereo modes.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALC_STEREO_BASIC_SOFT | Basic 2-channel mixing (e.g. pan-pot).
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALC_STEREO_UHJ_SOFT   | Stereo-compatible 2-channel UHJ surround encoding.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALC_STEREO_HRTF_SOFT  | 2-channel HRTF mixing.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALC_QUAD_SOFT         | Quadraphonic.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALC_SURROUND_5_1_SOFT | 5.1 Surround.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALC_SURROUND_6_1_SOFT | 6.1 Surround.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALC_SURROUND_7_1_SOFT | 7.1 Surround.

    The output mode attribute is only a hint to the device. If the requested
    mode can't be used, another one will be auto-selected.

    For loopback devices, ALC_STEREO_BASIC_SOFT, ALC_STEREO_UHJ_SOFT, and
    ALC_STEREO_HRTF_SOFT can be used to select basic, UHJ, or HRTF rendering
    when ALC_FORMAT_CHANNELS_SOFT is ALC_STEREO_SOFT. Otherwise, it is ignored
    and ALC_FORMAT_CHANNELS_SOFT determines the channel configuration.

    The current output mode can be queried using alcGetIntegerv. The returned
    mode may be ALC_ANY_SOFT when the device output can't be represented as
    one of the other enumerations, in which case the application should not
    assume any particular channel configuration or speaker layout.
