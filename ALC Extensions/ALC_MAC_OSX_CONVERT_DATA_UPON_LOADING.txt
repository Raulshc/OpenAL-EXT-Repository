Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.

Overview
        This extension allows the caller to tell OpenAL to preconvert to the
        native CoreAudio format, the audio data passed to the library with
        the alBufferData() call. Preconverting the audio data, reduces CPU
        usage by removing an audio data conversion (per source) at render
        time at the expense of a larger memory footprint.
