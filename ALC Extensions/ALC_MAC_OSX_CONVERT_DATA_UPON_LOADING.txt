***** ALC_MAC_OSX_CONVERT_DATA_UPON_LOADING
This extension allows the caller to tell OpenAL to preconvert to the native CoreAudio format, the audio data passed to the 
library with the alBufferData() call. Preconverting the audio data, reduces CPU usage by removing an audio data conversion 
(per source) at render time at the expense of a larger memory footprint.

/*  
  Convert Data When Loading.  
  Default false, currently applies only to monophonic sounds. Use with alEnable()/alDisable()
*/
