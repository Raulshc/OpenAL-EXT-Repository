Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.
        This extension requires ALC_EXT_EFX.

Overview

        This extension provides two "routing" EFX effects that allow sounds to be
        sent to dedicated speaker channels.
        Audio rendered to the dedicated low frequency effect
        (AL_EFFECT_DEDICATED_LOW_FREQUENCY_EFFECT) is routed to a subwoofer if one
        is present. Otherwise, it is discarded.

        Audio rendered to the dedicated dialogue effect (AL_EFFECT_DEDICATED_DIALOGUE)
        is routed to a front centre speaker if one is present. Otherwise, it is
        rendered to the front centre using the normal spatialisation logic.

        Both effects support a gain control parameter AL_DEDICATED_GAIN, which
        defaults to 1.
