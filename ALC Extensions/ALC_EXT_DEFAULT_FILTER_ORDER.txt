Overview

        This extension allows the default filter order (i.e. slope) to be selected
        at context creation time. Attibute ALC_DEFAULT_FILTER_ORDER can be used
        with a value of 1 (for -6dB/oct) or 2 (for -12dB/oct).

        ALC_DEFAULT_FILTER_ORDER can also be used with alcGetIntegerv to find out
        the current default filter order.
