ALC_ENUMERATE_ALL_EXT

The Enumerate All Extension enables the application developer to retrieve
a complete list of device strings identifying all the available OpenAL
rendering devices and paths present on the user's PC. It works in exactly
the same manner as the Enumeration Extension, but it detects additional
audio paths that the standard extension will ignore. For instance, it will
return all the possible outputs in situations where the user has more than
one audio device installed, or under Windows Vista where the audio system
specifies different "endpoints" for sound such as Speakers, S/PDIF, etc...
If you don't require such complete control over the choice of output path,
then use the standard Enumeration Extension.

Creative Implementations
This alternative Enumeration Extension will enumerate all the OpenAL devices 
on ***all*** the audio devices (including all the 'endpoints' on Windows Vista).
The original Enumeration Extension would only enumerate generic devices on the
Default playback device.

For example, on a Windows XP system with an SB X-Fi card and a SoundMAX Digital Audio
mother-board chip, the original Enumeration Extension provides a list like this: -

SB X-Fi Audio [9000]
Generic Hardware
Generic Software

The new 'Enumerate All' extension gives a complete list of all the possible output
configurations, i.e: -

SB X-Fi Audio [9000]
Generic Hardware on SB X-Fi Audio [9000]
Generic Software on SB X-Fi Audio [9000]
Generic Hardware on SoundMAX Digital Audio
Generic Software on SoundMAX Digital Audio

Note, at the time of writting, the SoundMAX Digital Audio solution does not include 
a 'native' AL component so the only options are the "Generic Hardware" and 
"Generic Software" devices.
