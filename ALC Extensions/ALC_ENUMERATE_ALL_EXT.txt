Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.

Overview

        The Enumerate All Extension enables the application developer to retrieve
        a complete list of device strings identifying all the available OpenAL
        rendering devices and paths present on the user's PC. It works in exactly
        the same manner as the Enumeration Extension, but it detects additional
        audio paths that the standard extension will ignore. For instance, it will
        return all the possible outputs in situations where the user has more than
        one audio device installed, or under Windows Vista where the audio system
        specifies different "endpoints" for sound such as Speakers, S/PDIF, etc...
        If you don't require such complete control over the choice of output path,
        then use the standard Enumeration Extension.

Issues

        Creative Implementations

        This alternative Enumeration Extension will enumerate all the OpenAL
        devices on ***all*** the audio devices (including all the 'endpoints' on
        Windows Vista).
        The original Enumeration Extension would only enumerate generic devices
        on the Default playback device.

        For example, on a Windows XP system with an SB X-Fi card and a SoundMAX
        Digital Audio mother-board chip, the original Enumeration Extension
        provides a list like this: -

        SB X-Fi Audio [9000]
        Generic Hardware
        Generic Software

        The new 'Enumerate All' extension gives a complete list of all the
        possible output configurations, i.e: -

        SB X-Fi Audio [9000]
        Generic Hardware on SB X-Fi Audio [9000]
        Generic Software on SB X-Fi Audio [9000]
        Generic Hardware on SoundMAX Digital Audio
        Generic Software on SoundMAX Digital Audio

        Note, at the time of writting, the SoundMAX Digital Audio solution
        does not include a 'native' AL component so the only options are the
        "Generic Hardware" and "Generic Software" devices.

New Procedures and Functions

        None

New Tokens

        Accepted as the <token> parameter of alcGetString:

        ALC_DEFAULT_ALL_DEVICES_SPECIFIER          0x1012
        ALC_ALL_DEVICES_SPECIFIER                  0x1013

Additions to Specification

        Retrieving all device names

        The developer can retrieve a string containing NULL-separated device name
        strings (the list is terminated with two consecutive NULL characters),
        and a string containing the name of the default device.

        To retrieve the string listing all the devices present, the developer should
        use the OpenAL function call alcGetString with the name
        "ALC_ALL_DEVICES_SPECIFIER".

        To retrieve the string containing the name of the default device, the
        developer should use the OpenAL function call alcGetString with the name
        "ALC_DEFAULT_ALL_DEVICES_SPECIFIER".

        Any of the strings returned by the Enumerate All extension can be used to
        create a device during initialization via alcOpenDevice.
