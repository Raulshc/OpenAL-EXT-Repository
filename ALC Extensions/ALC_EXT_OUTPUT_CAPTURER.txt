Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.

Overview
        Allows an application to capture the rendered output of the current context.
        The application prepares OpenAL for capturing the context output by specifying
        the data formatof the captured audio output data. Once capture has been started,
        the application then queries OpenALfor the available number of captured samples,
        and requests the samples by providing a buffer to fill.

        Retrieve functions via alcGetProcAddress() by passing in strings.

Additions to Specification

        API: alcOutputCapturerPrepare

        Prepare output capturing of the current context by specifying the data format
        desired from OpenAL.

        frequency      -  Sampling rate of the captured output.

        format         -  Data format of the captured data. Specified as one of the
                          native OpenAL data format types:

                              AL_FORMAT_MONO8
                              AL_FORMAT_MONO16
                              AL_FORMAT_STEREO8
                              AL_FORMAT_STEREO16

        maxsamplecount -  The maximum number of samples that will be requested by the
                          application.

        API: alcOutputCapturerStart

        Start capturing samples rendered by the current context to a maximum of the
        sample count specified when calling alcOutputCapturerPrepare.

        API: alcOutputCapturerStop

        Stop capturing samples rendered by the context. This function resets the captured
        audio samples to 0.

        API: alcOutputCapturerAvailableSamples

        Get the number of captured samples currently available.

        API: alcOutputCapturerSamples

        Write captured samples to an application provided buffer.

        buffer       -   Application provided buffer to be filled with the requested
                         amount of samples and must be of size samplecount * size of
                         sample.
                         i.e. 100 samples of AL_FORMAT_STEREO16 data -> 100 * 4 = 400 bytes.
                         The buffer must NOT be deallocated before the call to
                         alcOutputCapturerSamples returns.

        samplecount  -   Number of samples to be copied to the provided buffer.
                         Requesting more samples than currently available is an error.
