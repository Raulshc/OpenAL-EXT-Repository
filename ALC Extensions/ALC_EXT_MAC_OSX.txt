Dependencies

        This extension is written against the OpenAL 1.1 specification.

Overview

        The 'Apple Mac OSX Extension' contains various support for controlling
        aspects of Apple's OpenAL implementation that are specific to the 
        platform.
        The extension provides settings for:

         Rendering Quality   -   The Rendering Quality setting enables the
                                 application to specify from a number of
                                 available stereo/multi-channel rendering
                                 algorithms.

         Channel Count       -   Apple's OpenAL implementation will render to
                                 stereo or multi-channel audio hardware based
                                 on the users system setup.This setting can be
                                 used to force stereo rendering on a multi speaker
                                 audio system.

         Maximum Buses       -   This sets a maximum number of buses allocated by
                                 the system's 3DMixer AudioUnit, which provides
                                 the spatialized mixing of OpenAL.

         Output Rate         -   Allows the application to optimize audio mixing
                                 performance based on the sampling rate of its audio
                                 assets (files)
