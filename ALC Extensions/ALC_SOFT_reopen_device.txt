Dependencies

    This extension is for OpenAL 1.1.
    This extension interacts with ALC_EXT_disconnect.

Overview

    This extension provides a mechanism for applications to move the output of
    a device from one endpoint to another. Standard OpenAL devices are
    associated with an output on the system upon being opened, but if the
    endpoint should no longer be the desired output, there is no method for
    the application to easily change it. The only option for the application
    is to delete all AL objects, destroy the context, close the device handle,
    open a new device, and reload/recreate the necessary resources. A method
    to more simply move the device with its existing resources to a different
    output is easier, requiring less management from the application.

Additions to Specification

    Reopening a Device

    Once a playback device is opened, it becomes associated with a particular
    output endpoint. When this output is no longer the desired output, the
    playback device can be reopened to re-associate it with a potentially
    different output endpoint using alcReopenDeviceSOFT.

        ALCboolean alcReopenDeviceSOFT(ALCdevice *device,
            const ALCchar *deviceName, const ALCint *attribs);

    The <device> handle must be a non-NULL handle for an existing device.
    <deviceName> is the device name to open, or NULL for the default (same as
    would be passed to alcOpenDevice). <attribs> is an attribute list to
    configure the device with, with the same attribute list that would be
    passed to alcCreateContext.

    Returns ALC_TRUE on success, with output now on the requested device name.
    If the device was in a disconnected state with the device's ALC_CONNECTED
    attribute being ALC_FALSE, the device is also restored to a connected
    state. On failure, the device remains associated with the previous output,
    ALC_FALSE is returned and an error is generated that can be queried with
    alcGetError using the device handle.
